    <h1>Welcome to My First Website!</h1>
    <h3>**Looking for internship in summer 2021, contact info is in the footer**</h2>
    <p>
        Hi! If you're seeing this, I hope you give me the job &#128540;
    </p>
    <p>
        Let me tell you a little bit about this project, I made this website 
        while learning to code in HTML and CSS. I plan on updating it as I 
        learn other programming languages and web concepts to make it more 
        responsive and prettier, however as of now it will remain a simple 
        website. It might look like a website from the 90's and 00's right 
        now, however it will evolve as I acquire more web development 
        skills. I plan on landing a job as a full stack web developer 
        when I graduate college,therefore I have to start somewhere and this is it.
    </p>
    <p>
        This isn't the only website that I want to make, I want to make other 
        website with annimations and maybe an online game that college 
        students can play at parties (like kahoot, but more fun). Of 
        course all of these ideas are still concepts, I have to learn 
        programming before anything else. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This website will include the following information about me:
        <ul>
            <li>Education</li>
            <li>Projects</li>
            <li>My story</li>
            <li>Extracurricular (Education page)</li>
            <li>Experience</li>
            <li>Skills</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The "skills and experience" page will contain all my skills (technical and 
        non-technical) as well as my experience. I have decided to categorize 
        all the internships, co-ops and jobs that I have as experience. As of 
        November 19, 2020 this page might be blank for the experience section 
        because I have not done anything yet, however by summer 2021, I plan on 
        getting an internship, so hopefully I will have something by then.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the my "Education" page, you will find everything regarding my academics,
        I will share with you my high school education, universities, my major, 
        relevant courses, GPA etc. The content of this website will be delivered
        chronologically.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "projects" page will include a link to my github account, because all the 
        projects I have ever done are there. It will also include a detailed descrition 
        of whatever project I have done and why I decided to do them.
    </p>
    <p class="lastParagraph">
        The "More About Me" page will have my personal life story, I think I have a 
        story worthy of telling and hopefully you'll agree with me, if I've gotten
        a hold of your curiousity, head over there and read about me!
