        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <h3>Technical Skills: Java, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C</h3>
        <p>
            I've done school projects in both C and Java. This website is built using 
            JavaScript, HTML and CSS, I might not be an expert yet but if you're reading 
            this then I'm getting close &#128540;. I'm currently studying data structures
            and algorithms in Python, so i'm comfortable with it too. 
        </p>
        <h3>Software: VS Code, git, familiarity with Linux (Ubuntu)</h3>
        <p>
            All the software tools listed above were used in the production of this website. 
            VS Code is the editor in which I am typing right now the source code, git is the 
            tool I used to manage versions and Ubuntu is the operating system I am using at 
            this moment. 
        </p>
        <h3>Languages: English and Spanish</h3>
        <p>
            I'm bilingual, I can fluently speak both English and Spanish. If you head over
            the "More About Me" page, you'll find out that I was born in Mexico and learned 
            Spanish first. I picked up English in school as a youngster. 
        </p>
        <h3>Other: Problem solver, Listener, Inquisitive</h3>
        <p>
            As a prospective software engineer, I love solving software problems because 
            you get instant feedback on whether your solution works or not. I'm a listener, 
            I always value the opinions of others, specially if they are constructive ones. 
            I'm also Inquisitive, if a solution worked on the first try, I want to know why. 
            I know that the only way one can improve is by asking good questions.
