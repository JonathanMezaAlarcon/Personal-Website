    <h1>My Personal Story</h1>
    <h2>Early Years</h2>
    <img src="./Rincon-penitas.jpg" alt="Rincon Penitas, Mexico">
    <p>
        I was born on June 1st 2001 in a small village called Rincón Peñitas 
        in Guerrero, Mexico. When I was born, my father (18 years old at the 
        time) was in the US earning a living so that my mother (19 years old) 
        could afford everything she needed to take care of me. Being the first 
        child she ever had, she made her rookie mistakes but thankfully I 
        survived. Two years later my dad returned, but it wasn't long before
        he decided to leave once again but this time he took my mom with him. 
        The plan was to save enough to build a house, and they figured that two 
        workers would earn more than one, I was left with my grandmother for two 
        years. When they returned two years later, they realized that they had 
        gotten a little too comfortable with life in the US, so they decided to 
        make the journey once again, but this time they were bringing the whole 
        gang to the states (aka they were bringing me with them). According to 
        my mom they decided to bring me along with them this time because she 
        wanted me to be with them, she didn't want me to grow old without them. 
        So, the plan had changed a little, now not only were they hoping to save 
        for the house, but they wanted me to learn English so that when we eventually 
        returned, I could get a job as a translator in Acapulco, which was the 
        tourist hot spot of Mexico at the time. I guess the plan didn't work 
        because it's been 16 years and we're still here. I've spent so much time 
        in the US that I don't have a single memory of my birthplace.

    <h2>The Journey</h2>
    <p>
        When my parents and I crossed the Mexico-US border, I was 4 years old so I 
        have zero memories of that event. With that being said, most of the details 
        I know about this were told to me by my parents. According to them, we crossed 
        the famous Rio Grande, walked for 5 days, and we ran out of food and water, I'm 
        very lucky to have survived that. It wasn't until recently that I got curious and 
        asked my parents what state we first arrived too and what was the state that they 
        has in mind to go. My parents said that we first arrived to a small town in Texas, 
        where an old man brought us into his home and fed us. That was a kind gesture, 
        wasn't it? Well, apparently when we tried to leave and head to our desired state,
        the man stopped us, threatening to call the police. I don't know what he had in mind,
        but we didn't stay long enough to figure out because as soon as my parents had a
        chance, we yeeted ourselves out a window and left. Eventually we made it to Florida, 
        and over the next 5 to 6 years, we travelled from Florida to Pennsylvia, Kentucky, 
        North Carolina and back to Florida where we haven't moved since I started Middle
        School. Since then I've had a normal life, I went to school, made friends, got good 
        grades, played sports etc. I've haven't experienced anything that a regular 
        American teenager wouldn't.

        I'm very grateful that I'm alive right now. I always had a vague memory that while
        hiking from Mexico to America, we found a man that was very sick and was starving. 
        We fed him but he rejected the food we gave him, my last memory of that person was
        that we had to leave him behind because we simple couldn't stay there for long or 
        we wouldn't make it. I asked my mom whether that actually happened or whether my 
        mind was making it all up, it was real. This sometimes makes me think that I'm 
        fortunate I'm alive, things could've easily gone wrong and I wouldn't be working 
        on this project right now.
