    <h1>My Projects so Far</h1>
    <p>
        As of December 10<sup>th</sup> 2020, most of the projects that I have done are 
        for my introduction to programming classes. This website is the first project
        that I am doing outside of my classes. Because of this, you will find that most 
        of these projects aren't very creative, they're bland and very simple. Up until 
        now, I did not feel confident with my programming skills, however now I feel 
        like they're good enough to create a website to put on my resume.

        <h2>Personal Website</h2>
        <h3>Fall 2020 - Javascript, CSS, HTML 
            <br>
            <a class="project-links" 
            href="#" onclick="MyFunction();">
            Source Code</a></h3>
        <p>
            This is a work in progress, so the link to the source code of this project may not 
            be available depending on when you're trying to access it. I think this project is 
            self explanatory, I wanted to do a something that would make me stand out 
            from other students, so making a personal website was the only thing that I thought
            made sense. I want to work as a full stack software engineer after college, 
            so getting as comfortable with the frontend as possible is the first thing on my 
            to-do list. As of right now, this website does not contain a backend, its pure 
            CSS, HTML, and vanilla Javascript. This website is basically an online resume.

        <h2>Elementary Level Math Quiz</h2>
        <h3>Spring 2020 - Java 
            <br>
            <a class="project-links" 
            href="https://github.com/JonathanMezaAlarcon/COP3330_Assignment3">
            Souce Code</a></h3>
        <p> 
            This project was a course project for my COP 3330 Object Orientated Programming 
            course. The project is divided into 5 different files labeled CAI1 through CAI5.
            As the files go from CAI1 to CAI5, new features are added to the math quiz. The 
            purpose of this project was to learn object orientated programming and implement 
            the topics that we have been learning in the lectures up unitl that point.

        <h2>MIPS Processor Simulator</h2>
        <h3>Spring 2020 - C 
            <br>
            <a class="project-links" 
            href="https://github.com/JonathanMezaAlarcon/CDA3103_Final_Project">
            Source Code</a></h3>
        <p>
            This was the final project of my CDA 3103 Computer Logic and organization course. 
            This project was completed in a group of 3, each one of the group members was in 
            charge of different functions of the project, it was up to that person to fully 
            understand what his assigned funciton was supposed to do. The project required us 
            to simulate the datapath of the MIPS processor, based on the different instructions
            the program was given (in binary) it should execute different actions.
