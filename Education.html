            I attended the International Baccalaureate program at Strawberry Crest High School, 
            in Dover FL. I graduated in May 31<sup>st</sup>, 2019 with a GPA of 5.99 and in the 
            top 10% of my class. While at Strawberry Crest, I tried to be as involved in school 
            activities as possible. I played goalkeeper for the varsity soccer team for two years,
            I volunteered for about 150 CAS hours (100 community service hours, 25 action hours, and 
            25 creative hours), I was very involved in the Interact club, a community service based 
            club, the National Honor Society, the French Honor Society and a few other sport-based 
            clubs. After High School, I attended the University of Central Florida for one year, 
            after which I transferred to the University of South Florida.

            After attending the University of Central Florida for the 2019-2020 school year, I 
            transferred to the University of South Florida. My major is Information science with 
            a concentration in web technologies, I currently have a GPA of 4.00 (but this can 
            obviously change), I'm in my sophomore year, and if everything goes well, I will 
            graduate in Spring 2023 (or sooner). I'm a member of the Society of Hipanic 
            Professional Engineers (SHPE), however I hope to eventually become the President of
            the organization. I will update this website if I ever accomplish this. Unfortunately, 
            I haven't been as involved in college activities as I was with high school activities, 
            however I plan on changing this. So far SHPE is the only organization that I'm involved
            with but as soon as the covid restrictions are lowered or removed, I will join other
            organizations, I will look into those that help with leadership and improve my network.
