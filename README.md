# Personal-Website

Welcome! This repository contains the source code for my personal website.

December 13th, 2020: I'm still learning HTML, CSS and javascript, if you see this before the next log, just know that I am fixing my code in my local repository
                     because I know that semantically, its all over the place. I'm also getting used to git, so I decided to put my code on github even though it's
                     still being worked on because I wanted to use git. 
                     
                     
THIS RESPOSITORY IS NOT LONGER BEING MAINTAINED
